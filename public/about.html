<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m a creative UI/UX designer with a strong passion for visual storytelling and graphic design. I love shaping interfaces that feel intuitive, engaging, and delightful—combining color, space, and typography to turn big ideas into polished realities. With experience crafting logos, illustrations, and digital artwork, I bring graphic skills to every project, making visuals that speak as clearly as words. My focus is always on the user, believing that every great design starts by solving a real problem for real people. The synergy between usability and aesthetics is where I do my best work, and I’m always looking to strike that perfect balance.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve taken on the exciting journey of learning front-end development. Bridging design and code is giving me new perspectives into how my interfaces actually come to life in the browser. Each day, I explore HTML, CSS, modern frameworks, and the creative power of the web. I love the process of transforming static graphics into living, breathing web experiences, and seeing ideas grow from sketch to interactive product. This drive keeps me curious and motivated to learn and experiment more.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I find inspiration in music, digital art, and the creative communities I’m part of. I believe in lifelong learning, open collaboration, and the philosophy that every project is a fresh opportunity to grow as both a designer and a frontend engineer. My goal: to craft solutions that not only look stunning, but also genuinely improve the way people interact with the world around them.</p>
